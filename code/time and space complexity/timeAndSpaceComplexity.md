# Time and Space Complexity

# Time Complexity

Time complexity of the algorithim is the represented of the amount of time required by the algorithm to execut the completion.

Time complexity denoted by **t(n)**.

where,

* t(n)  is time taken for input size n.

How to check alogrithim efficienecy:-

There are two type of check of alogrithim efficienency

**Time factor**

    Time factor is calculated or measured by counting the number of key operations such as compersion of sorting alogrithom.

**Space Factor**

    The Space is calculated or measured counting the by maxmum memory space required by algorithim.

**Type of Notation for Time Complexity**

There are four type of time complexity.

**Big Oh** : -

    1. This is called worst time complexity.

    2. Value search all array than value is not find

    3. denotes " fewer than or same as"`<expresion> iteration`

**Big Omega:-**

    1. This is called best time complexity.

    2. Element find in 1st index.

    3. Denote "more than or same as"`<expresion> iteration`

**Big Theta:-**

    1. This is called Average Time Complexity.

    2. Value find in middle in array.

    3. Denote "The same as"`<expresion> iteration`

**Letter Oh: -**

    1. denote "more than"`<expresion> iteration`

# Space Complexity

Space complexity of an algorithim represents the amount of memory space the algorithim needed in its life cycle.
