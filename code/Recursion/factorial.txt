Factorial
Easy

1. You are given a number n.
2. You are required to calculate the factorial of the number. Don't change the signature of factorial function.

Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is.Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

Constraints
0 <= n <= 10

Format
Input
A number n

Output
factorial of n

Example
Sample Input

5

Sample Output
120

code :-

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

        // write your code here
        Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scn.nextInt();
        int fn = factorial(n);
        System.out.print(fn);
    }

    public static int factorial(int n){
        //base condition -> 1
        if(n==0){
            return 1;
        }

        //faith -> 2
        int fac = factorial(n-1);

        //mywork -> 3
        int ans = fac *n;
        return ans;
    }
